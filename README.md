# GPT-2 Model Implementation in TensorFlow

## Overview
This project is a TensorFlow implementation of the GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) model, featuring a modular architecture with multi-head self-attention, transformer blocks, and a full language model configuration.

## Model Architecture

### Key Components
- `MultiHeadSelfAttention`: Implements multi-head attention mechanism
- `FeedForwardNetwork`: Provides non-linear transformation
- `TransformerBlock`: Combines attention and feed-forward layers
- `GPT2`: Top-level model class

### Features
- Supports configurable embedding dimensions
- Flexible number of transformer layers
- Causal masking for autoregressive prediction
- Position and token embeddings

## Requirements
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Python 3.7+

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## Model Configuration
- Vocabulary Size: 50,257 (standard GPT-2 vocabulary)
- Maximum Sequence Length: 1,024 tokens
- Default Embedding Dimension: 768
- Default Transformer Layers: 12
- Default Attention Heads: 12

## Hyperparameters
- Embedding Dimension: 768
- Feed-Forward Dimension: 3,072
- Dropout Rate: 0.1
- Layer Normalization Epsilon: 1e-6

## Usage Example
```python
# Create the model
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(MAX_LENGTH,), dtype=tf.int32)
outputs = GPT2(vocab_size=VOCAB_SIZE, max_length=MAX_LENGTH)(inputs)
gpt2 = Model(inputs, outputs)

# Build and compile the model
gpt2.build(input_shape=(1, MAX_LENGTH))
gpt2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
```

## Limitations
- This is a base implementation and requires pre-trained weights for practical use
- Not optimized for inference or large-scale training
- Requires additional code for tokenization and data preprocessing

## Future Improvements
- Add support for gradient checkpointing
- Implement mixed-precision training
- Add distributed training capabilities
